            <p>Answering big questions about planetary climate requires powerful, flexible tools. Standard climate models are built for Earth, 
            but what about planets with different atmospheres, orbits, or stars?</p>
            
            <p>I am the primary developer and maintainer of <strong>ExoCAM</strong>, an open-source 3D climate model built upon the National Center for 
               Atmospheric Research's (NCAR) Community Earth System Model (CESM). ExoCAM is designed to simulate the climates of a vast range of worlds, 
               from ancient Earth to distant exoplanets orbiting other stars.</p>
            
            <p> At the core of ExoCAM is <strong>ExoRT</strong>, a flexible two-stream correlated-K radiative transfer model.</p>

            <p>ExoCAM and ExoRT are publicly available community tools that are used by numerous research groups worldwide. My focus is on 
               developing robust, open-source software that empowers the entire field of planetary science. You can read the primary paper on ExoCAM here:</p>

            <h3> Exploring the Limits of Habitability</h3>
            
            <figure class="float-left">
                <img src="/images/trappist1_planets.jpg" alt="An artist's concept of the TRAPPIST-1 system, showing multiple rocky planets orbiting a red dwarf star.">
                <figcaption>Artist's concept of the TRAPPIST-1 system, a key target for habitability studies.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>What makes a planet capable of supporting life? My research uses the tools I build, like ExoCAM, to map the "habitable zone" 
               and understand what newly discovered planets might actually look like.</p>
            
            <p>By simulating these alien environments in 3D, we can move beyond simple definitions of habitability. I've explored the climates of 
               key targets like the **TRAPPIST-1** system, the resilience of habitable climates on planets in **circumbinary star systems** (like Tatooine),
               and the fundamental physics that sets the **"inner edge"** of the habitable zone—the point where a planet's oceans would boil away.</p>

            <h3> Our Planet's Alien Past (and Future)</h3>
            
            <figure class="float-right">
                <img src="/images/pale_orange_dot.jpg" alt="An artist's concept of the Archean Earth, showing a hazy, orange-tinted sky and simple land masses.">
                <figcaption>Artist's concept of the "Pale Orange Dot"—the Archean Earth with a fractal organic haze.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Long before humans, Earth itself was an "alien" world. For billions of years, life existed under a Sun that was up to 25% fainter than it is today. 
               How did life survive, and what did our planet look like?</p>
            
            <p>My foundational research investigated this **"Faint Young Sun Paradox."** I used climate models to show that **fractal organic hazes**, similar to 
               those on Saturn's moon Titan, could have formed in the Archean atmosphere. These hazes would have provided a critical UV shield for early life while 
               still allowing the planet to stay warm—transforming the early Earth into a "Pale Orange Dot." </p>

            <h3> What's Next? Current & Future Research</h3>
            
            <p>Science is always moving. My current work is focused on bridging the gap between our theoretical models and the first-ever observations of terrestrial exoplanets from telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).</p>

            <p>I am leading a multi-model collaboration to interpret potential observations of the well-known **TRAPPIST-1e** system. By comparing the results from many different climate and chemistry models, we can better understand what we are *really* seeing and provide a more robust interpretation of a planet's atmosphere.</p>

            <p>My future research will dive deeper into one of the most complex and important topics in planetary climate: **atmospheric hazes**.  With new funding from NASA, my next major project will explore how hazes form on planets orbiting different types of stars. This work will help us understand how hazes affect a planet's climate and, critically, how they would influence its observable spectrum.</p>
